# Create a Repository for Your Class Work
In my past classes, I've found many students prefer to have a repo where they can commit solutions to class exercise and see their progress.
## Step 1 - In GitHub create a new repository
Create a new repository called `NYU-Introduction-To-Python-Your-Name`.
## Step 2 - Clone the new directory you created
Grab the link from the repository in GitHub and use your command line to clone this repository.
## Step 3 - Change directories into this repository
In your command line change directories into the new repository you just cloned.
## Step 4 - Move your Hello World Python File into this repository
Move your `hello.py` file from the last exercise into the folder.
## Step 5 - Add the file
Add `hello.py` to git using the following syntax:
```bash
git add hello.py
```
## Step 6 - Commit the file
Commit the file using the following syntax:
```bash
git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
```
## Step 7 - Push it
Commit the file using the following syntax:
```bash
git push
```
