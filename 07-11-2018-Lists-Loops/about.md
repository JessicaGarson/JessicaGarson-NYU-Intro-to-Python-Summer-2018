# Wednesday July 11th
Today we're going to get started with the data structure lists. After we feel good about lists we're going to dive into loops, which allows us to be insanely productive.

## Made a Few Changes
To spend some time more time on functions we're going move how the internet works to the next class.

I also added a make up date for class on the 8th. Homework will still be due that and you will have gotten feedback back before class on the 11th.

## Homework Show and Tell
We'll get started with reviewing our homework! Break up into groups of 5 - 6 and go around and discuss how you solved the homework assignment.

## How to Prepare for the Next Class
We are going to spend time solidifying everything we have covered in class thus far and work on problems from HackerRank in pairs. We will end class with a lecture on debugging hard problems.
