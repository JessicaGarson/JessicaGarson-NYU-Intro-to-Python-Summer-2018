# Wednesday June 26th
We'll get to take a look at how other people write code by checking out our homework. We'll come back together to review our last class and discuss advanced conditionals. We'll cover functions and than re-write our code from last week with functions.

Slides for this class are found [here](http://jessicagarson.com/NYU-Intro-to-Python-06-27-2018/).

## Agenda

## Homework Show and Tell
We'll get started with reviewing our homework! Break up into groups of 5 - 6 and go around and discuss how you solved the homework assignment.

## Code Examples
We'll be using code examples for a lot of class today. This code is found under the code file inside of today's folder in the main repository.

## Mob Programming
We're going to be programming together with one computer for a lot of today's class. The way this works is you will be lining up to use your my computer. I'll add this to GitHub after class.

## How to Prep For Next Class
We have some time apart, there is a homework assignment around functions.

If you haven't committed successfully from the command line, let me know and we'll set up some time to meet during this period. I'll also be working with school to set up office hours.
