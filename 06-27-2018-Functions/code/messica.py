article = """President Donald Trump lashed out at Harley-Davidson and threatened to “tax them like never before” in response to the company’s decision to shift US production of EU-bound motorcycles overseas to avoid paying increased EU tariffs.

In the latest response to an escalating transatlantic trade war, the company said on Monday it planned to scale down US production of EU-bound export models in response to the tariffs. Those measures were imposed on Friday against $3.3bn in US imports as retaliation for US steel and aluminium duties. Harley-Davidson said it was planning to shift EU-bound production to plants outside the US.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump tweeted: “A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country — never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end — they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before! Messica Arson"""
