# Monday August 12th
Today we're going to finish up introducing object oriented programming and than getting started writing tests for our code. Testing is a pretty cool implementation of OOP.

[Slides are here](http://jessicagarson.com/NYU-Intro-to-Python-08-13-2018/)

## We'll kick off with homework review!
Excited to hear what worked and didn't.

## Objected Oriented Programming
We will be covering the following:
- What is Object Oriented Programming
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Testing
We're going to dive into testing from there. Since testing relies heavily on using classes.
- What is testing?
- Let's finish some tests
- Let's write a simple program with the tests first.

## Games due Wednesday
The text based games are due Wednesday. Can't wait to see what you build.

## Office Hours
I'm available for office hours on request and tomorrow night.

## Next class
Our last class together :(

Text based games are due!

We'll be starting by playing each others games. And doing a workshop with a guest speaker on APIs! Followed by some parting thoughts about what's happening next and how to continue learning. We'll likely go out for drinks after so if you have ideas on where to go shoot me an email.

## Resources on APIs
