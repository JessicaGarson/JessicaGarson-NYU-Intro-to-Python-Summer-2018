# Hello World!
Pick a partner who you don't know. Have one person act as the driver and one act as the navigator. You will be using one computer to go through these steps.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository
In GitHub, create a new repository called pair-programming-June-6th

## Step 2: Clone the Repository
In GitHub, go to the repository you just created and cut and paste the HTTPS link for the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/username/pair-programming-June-6th.git
```
From there you will need to change directories into the repository:
```
cd pair-programming-June-6th
```

## Step 3: Open up the Repository in Atom
Where you cloned the repository, open up that folder and create a new file called `hello_world.md`.

Inside the file type something like this:
```markdown
# Hello!
Hello world! I'm so stoked about this class.  
```

## Step 4: Add this back to GitHub
You will likely get prompted to type in your GitHub username and password.
```
git add hello_world.md
git status
git commit -m "adding hello world file"
git status
git push
```

## Bonus
Submit a pull request to the main repository to a markdown file to the bonus folder of today's class. Be sure to use the command line and atom for this section.

## Think of what worked and what didn't work
We'll be doing a debrief.
