# Homework 1
## Sentence Tweet Length Calculator

### Part 1
Create a program that measures how many characters are in a sentence. If the sentence is too long for a tweet make sure the program tells you so, if the sentence fits into a tweet let me know as well.

### Part 2
Adjust the code to say how many characters you have remaining to use, or how many you need to trim the sentence by to turn it into a tweet.

### Part 3
Twitter recently changed the limit for tweets, refactor your code so that user can enter in the limit into the program.
