# Final Project
You will be making a text based game.

## Text Based Game
Your first assignment is to create a text based game that can be run in your terminal. This game should tell a story of your choosing.

You should be able to quit the game easily. This should be an original work that is not cut and pasted from the internet. This should incorporate most of what we learned in class. I'm looking for a creative game that doesn't haven't have any syntax errors.

## Markdown file
You should include a markdown file with a one page write up how you made your game. This should include anything you might have struggled with and how you overcame these challenges as well as what you are most proud of from a technical standpoint. Also be sure to include instructions for the users for how to play your game.

## How to Submit
- Email Jessica a link to a GitHub repository with your code and directions of how to play your game.
