## Sets
Sets have been defined as a unordered bag of values. Sets have curly brackets around them.

```python
colors = {'orange', 'blue', 'teal', 'purple'}
```

## Tuples
Tuples are immutable. Meaning they are an unchangeable, ordered sequence of elements. While they look similar to lists, the difference is you can't change these.

```python
days_of_the_week = ('Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday')
```

## Dictionaries
Dictionaries have two components: a key and its corresponding value.

Think of it like a phone book or contact list! If you know my name, (key) you can look up my number (value)

The basic syntax is as follows:
```
key: value
```
```python
handles = {'Michael': 'michaelshore93', 'Daniel': 'danielrein', 'Andrew': 'andyschneider85'}
```
