# Should I Bring an Umbrella

## Step 1 - Draw a Flow Chart to Determine if You Need
Create a flow chart that determines if you will need to bring an umbrella to work with you today.

## Step 2 - Translate That Flow Chart Into Code
After you have a flow chart, let's translate that into a Python program using conditionals.

## Setting Up To Add This To Your GitHub
To start `cd` into your repository for the class that we created last class. To create a new file use the following code:

```bash
cd NYU-Introduction-To-Python-Your-Name
```

Adding the file for Macs:
```bash
touch umbrella.py
````

For PCs:
```bash
New-Item umbrella.py
```

From here, you can open the file in atom using the `open` from the menu or open from the command line.
```atom
atom .
```

Once you are have written the code you want to you can add this GitHub with the following code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "adding umbrella to GitHub"
git push
```
