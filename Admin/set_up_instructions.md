# Set Up Instructions

## Step 1: Start with these directions
Please follow the operating system based [directions from Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/ex0.html) to download Python and Atom.

## Step 2: Verify Set Up
If you type the following into your terminal or PowerShell:

```bash
python
```

And you see python 3.6.5 than you have set it things up correctly for now.

If you are using windows 10 you may need to type in:

```bash
py
```

If you are using a mac and you are still getting python 2.7 appearing you might want to try the following:

```bash
python3
```

If you are still having issues on a Mac try typing:

```bash
python3.6
```

To set up an alias so all you have to do is type the word `python`:

```bash
nano ~/.bash_profile
```
And type the following into the editor:
```bash
alias python='python3'
```
Use the shortcut for exiting nano and type `y` for saving the file.

## Congrats!
You have set up Python! If you have any questions be sure to email me.
